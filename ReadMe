Getting Started
To begin using the MotorPh Payroll System, users need to ensure they meet the fundamental requirements outlined in this section. Hardware prerequisites may include a computer or mobile device with internet connectivity, while software prerequisites may involve a compatible web browser or dedicated application. Accessing the system can typically be done through a web link provided by the organization or via a dedicated application downloaded from an app store.



Hardware Prerequisites
Users need to ensure they have access to compatible hardware to use the MotorPh Payroll System effectively. This may include a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone with internet connectivity. Adequate hardware ensures smooth system operation and optimal user experience.

Software Prerequisites
In addition to hardware requirements, users must also meet certain software prerequisites to access the MotorPh Payroll System. This may involve using a supported web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. Alternatively, users may need to download and install a dedicated application from the relevant app store, depending on the system's configuration.

Accessing The System
Once users have met the necessary hardware and software prerequisites, accessing the MotorPh Payroll System is straightforward. Users can typically access the system through a web link provided by their organization or by downloading and installing a dedicated application. Upon accessing the system, users will be prompted to log in using their unique credentials, granting them access to the system's features based on their assigned role and permissions.

Using The Payroll System

Secure Login Procedures
The process of securely logging into the MotorPh Payroll System begins with the employee and admin opening the system and navigating to the login screen prompted to choose what role they are, either employee or admin. Here, they are prompted to enter their unique credentials, which include an email address and a password. These details are then submitted to the system via the Login class, which functions to verify the entered credentials against the stored user data in the system's database. If the credentials are found to be correct and match an existing user profile, the system grants access to the user, allowing them to proceed to the main dashboard of the payroll system. This process ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive payroll information and functionality, safeguarding employee data and company resources.

Salary and Deduction Calculations
The calculation of salaries and deductions within the MotorPh Payroll System is a comprehensive process that takes into account various factors to ensure accurate payroll management. Initially, the system calculates the monthly salary of each employee using the Finance composition class. This involves determining the gross salary based on the hourly rate multiplied by the hours worked, as recorded in the attendance system. Following this, the system computes the applicable deductions for each employee through the Deductions class. This includes calculating the contributions for SSS, PhilHealth, withholding tax, and PagIbig, based on the current rates and the employee's gross salary. Additionally, the Allowance class calculates any applicable allowances, such as rice subsidy, phone allowance, and clothing allowance, adding these to the gross salary. The net salary is then derived by subtracting the total deductions from the gross salary plus allowances, providing a clear and accurate reflection of the employee's take-home pay for the month.

Leave Applications
Applying for leave within the MotorPh Payroll System is designed to be a straightforward yet flexible process to accommodate the diverse needs of the workforce. An employee wishing to apply for leave starts by accessing the Request class interface, where they can select the type of request they wish to make, in this case, a leave request. Within the Leave class, the employee specifies the leave type (vacation, sick, maternity/paternity, bereavement, leave without pay) and inputs the required details such as the start date, end date, and reason for the leave. This information is then submitted for processing within the system. The request goes through a workflow where it can be reviewed, approved, or rejected by the HR personnel. Upon approval, the leave is recorded, and the employee's leave balance is updated accordingly. This system ensures a transparent and efficient process for managing leave applications, allowing for easy tracking and administration of employee leave entitlements.
